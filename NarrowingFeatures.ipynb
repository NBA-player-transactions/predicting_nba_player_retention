    "Summary as of 11/12 at 1:30 pm: Based on correlation info, basic knowlegdge of basketball, and the preliminary trials with the original data, I came up with three different classes of feature to train a model on. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The correlation features (the features that have the highest correlation with being traded or waived by the end of next season) (abbreviated CORR)\n",
    "- The intuitive features (the feature that seem to me, subjectively, to be the ones most likely to predict player movement) (INTUIT)\n",
    "- The basic features (the in-game statistics that we ran some preliminary models on) (BASE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since being waived (and perhaps being traded as well) are correlated with number of minutes played, all in-game stats that are not percentages are rescaled to be per minute (e.g. points per minute). \n",
    "\n",
    "I've tried looking at two predictors: Is the player waived or traded by the end of next season (END_NEXT), and is the player waived (but not necessarily traded) by the start of the season (START_NEXT). In none of these six attempts is the F1 score particularly high we have the following table, though the accuracy increase quite a bit with the shorter time horizon of START_NEXT. These are all for KNN-classifiers; I tried logistic regression too, but in all cases the F1 score was worse.\n",
