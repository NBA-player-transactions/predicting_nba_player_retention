# Data Collection

In this folder, we collect the data used for modeling. We collect 4 categories
of data:

- Counting stats
- Advanced stats
- Salaries
- Transactions

We create a subfolder for each category. Within each folder, we provide:

- A README.md file with a description of the data collected.
- Jupyter notebook(s) (if applicable) using in data collection.
- One or more csv files containing the collected data.
