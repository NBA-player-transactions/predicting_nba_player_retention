Description

The premise is to try to predict whether a given NBA player will be moved (traded or waived) at some point during the current season. Instead of using categorical output (yes/no to being traded/waived) we would like to output a probability of being moved.

The predictors could be a combination of player performance (for which stats are abundant) in addition to contract size (available, likely will need to be scraped), age, and data about the team rosters. The dependent variable, namely whether or not a player is moved, is easy to obtain (https://pypi.org/project/pro-sports-transactions/), which says it has over 150,000 entries (so plenty of data!).
